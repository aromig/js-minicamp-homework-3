# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects
	  * An object is a group of key and value pairs. Like an array, you can store multiple values. However an array's values are accessed using an index (0, 1, 2, etc). Object values are accessed using a property. object.property = 'value'
	* Properties
	  * A property is a variable that belongs to an object. This can be anything. Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, etc.
	* Methods
	  * Methods are functions that belong to an object. You can access them just like any other function but you preface them with the object name. e.g. object.function();
	* for in loop
	  * This is a type of 'for loop' where it goes through an entire collection (array/object) without having to use an index counter. e.g. for (var key in object) { object[key] = value; }
	* dot notation vs bracket notation
	  * These are different ways of referencing object properties. Dot notation may be easier to read at times. Bracket notation is especially useful if the property is being referenced using variables (such as when the variable is passed into a function or a for in loop) or has special characters. *** The general rule is to use dot notation if possible. If you can't, use bracket notation.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
